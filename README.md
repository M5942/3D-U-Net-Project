# 3D U-Net Project
### This project is a 3D U-Net implementation used to perform biomedical image segmentation on the Tc1 Mouse cerebellum atlas. 
### The project is based on the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06650 
### The GPU version of Tensorflow is used for training and inference, so if the user wants to run the code with GPU, and they do not already have this version of TensorFlow, they need to install the GPU version of Tensorflow along with CUDA and CUDNN. Instructions can be found on [TensorFlow's Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip). 
Note: The GPU version of TensorFlow is not in the requirements.txt file, so it would have to be installed individually. The version of tensorflow-gpu used here is 2.10.0
